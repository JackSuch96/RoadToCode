    <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        <p> Firstly, please let me say hey!</p> 
        <p> I'm Jack, an MBA / CMI qualified aspiring Developer. Since graduating from University
            of Salford with a Marketing BSc, I've been embroided in the
            tech community as the Tech Recruiter for
            <a href= 'http://www.thecandidate.co.uk' title='The Candidate Recruitment Agency'> 
            The Candidate</a>.<br></p>
        <p> After over 5 years in the <span class= 'Recruitmentisevil'> Recruitment</span><!--Class Rie in standout-->
            industry (and yes <span class='Recruitmentisevil'> Recruitment</span> 
            is the Devil's work), I've taken it upon myself to learn to code with
            a vision of growing into a Developer role. </p>
        <p> Having recruited candidates into most tech roles under the sun, including:
            <ul>
                <li>Graduate Software Engineer</li>
                <li>Web Developer</li>
                <li>UX Designer</li>
                <li>Head of Software Development</li>
                <li>Full Stack Engineer</li>
            </ul>
            I found myself obsessed with the realities that talented techies
            understand the modern world in a way that most never will.</p>
        <p> With that in mind, I embarked on Udemy &amp; Colt Steele's 
            <a href= 'https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/' 
            title='Link to The Web Developer Bootcamp on Udemy'> Web Developer Bootcamp</a>
            to improve my knowledge and grow towards my aspiration of 
            becoming a Developer.</p>
